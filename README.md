# Project 2 Summary

For Project 2, we needed to create a program to train an ai to complete a maze. This project/file was called the Treasure Hunt Game. Our ai (pirate agent) needed to complete the maze, or find the treasure, as fast as possible using exploration and exploitation. Most of the code was already there, except for the looping/learning aspect. If you look at the project file, you can see there is a section with a “TODO” header; this is the code I added. The code loops through the epochs given and uses q-learning to solve the maze.

# Computer Science

Computer scientists research and create algorithms, data structures, and systems to address challenges and further technological progress. This extends across many fields, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, software engineering, computer graphics, and beyond.
There are many ways to approach a problem as a computer scientist. Here are a few:
1.	Research and gather information.
2.	Designing and implementing a solution.
3.	Testing and debugging.
4.	Documenting and communicating.

As a computer scientist there are ethical responsibilities both to end users and the organizations you work for. Here are a few:
1.	Security.
2.	Following user privacy and data protection guidelines.
3.	Transparency.
4.	Professional integrity.
